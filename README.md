# Microcitation parser


Tools to parse "microcitations" to literature in the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) and elsewhere.


## BHL database

In the `data` directory there is a simple JSON file that stores titles and the corresponding BHL TitleID. There his no attempt to clean or normalise the titles, we simply match what we have. In the development version we can add new matches to this file.

There is also a SQLite database of BHL data. The table `title` is generated by fetching the file [title.txt](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/data/hosted/title.txt) from BHL, extracting just the three columns that we need using `php parse-titles.php > titles.tsv` then using `php import-titles.php` to load that into SQLite.
